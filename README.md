# Responsive Design


## Description 

The motivation of this project was to gain hands-on experience designing a Responsive website with multiple pages to navigate to using a variety of devices without losing the ease of use for the end-user.  Through the utilization of Bootstrap I had to troubleshoot, and redesign the application to ensure responsive design, and validate the HTML.  I added a favicon to my pages to create a more appealing visual experience. In addition, this project allowed me to start being comfortable with describing myself, and finding solutions to problems on my own, or within my study-group.
